The study analyzes the public's perception of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in daily life. It focuses on AI applications in personal assistants, vehicles, and healthcare. The survey finds a dual perception of AI: high interest in its use in vehicles and virtual assistants, but lower interest and concern about its use in prescription purchases and medical applications. The study reveals that 67% of respondents believe AI in vehicles poses a medium to low risk, while 29% find AI-assisted purchasing interesting. Age plays a significant role, with younger respondents showing more interest in AI applications than older ones.

The use of AI in the medical field is being implemented to develop machines that can diagnose diseases accurately through symptoms and test results. The AI systems can also recommend treatments based on patient profiles and can be used for patient follow-ups. 41% of survey respondents find this implementation interesting, but 26% are not in favor. Younger people and men are more supportive of AI in medicine. However, 64% of respondents have medium to low confidence in AI medical systems, citing concerns over the absence of human empathy and potential commercial interests.
